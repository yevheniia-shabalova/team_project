## Roles

## Description
This project aims to identify relationships between weekly sales and various factors using the Walmart dataset. We will explore how the following variables impact weekly sales:

Temperature
CPI
Unemployment Rate
Fuel Price
IsHoliday (whether the week is a special holiday week)
Our goal is to analyze these factors comprehensively and derive insights that could potentially help optimize sales strategies and operations.


## Decision-Making and Collaboration

**How will you select your dataset?** - We collectively decided to use the Walmart dataset due to its relevance to retail sales and availability of diverse variables that could impact sales performance.

**How will you make sure all team members can contribute to the project?** - we established regular syncs in our chat and also regular meetings within live sessions.

**How will you make decisions?** - Decisions are made through consensus during team meetings. We prioritize open communication and value input from all members to ensure well-informed and collaborative decisions.

**What is the question you're trying to answer through your data analysis?** - The primary question we aim to answer through our data analysis is: "What factors most significantly influence weekly sales at Walmart?"

**What tasks need to be completed to get to your final output?** - Tasks have been allocated based on our expertise. These include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and interpretation of results.

**What is the primary focus within the dataset?** - The primary focus within the dataset is to understand the relationships between various predictor variables (like temperature, CPI, unemployment rate, fuel price, and holidays) and weekly sales.

**What are potential relationships in the data that you could explore?** - Potential relationships we aim to explore include how changes in temperature, economic indicators (like unemployment rate and fuel price), and holiday seasons impact weekly sales.

**What are key questions your project could answer?** - 

Key questions our project aims to answer include:

1. How does temperature affect weekly sales?
2. What impact does store size have on sales performance?
3. Is there a correlation between unemployment rate and sales?
4. How do holidays influence weekly sales patterns?
