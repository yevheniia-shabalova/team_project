# Team Project

## Description
The team project is broken up into 2 mini-modules. The first team project will be at the halfway mark of the certification. There you will be assigned to a team of 4, and you'll collaboratively create a simple program with a database to analyze a dataset from Kaggle or another open-sourced dataset.

In the second team project, you will work with the same team members again, and take your first team project and depending on your stream, you will create a:

1. Data visualization
2. Machine Learning Model

This project will be used as part of your portfolio!

#### Project Description

* [First Team Project Description](./team-project-1.md)
* [Second Team Project Description](./team-project-2.md)

## Learning Outcomes
In the first team project:
* Identify the causes of merge conflicts
* Solve merge conflicts through the use of rebasing
* Create a program as a team to analyze a dataset

In the second team project:
* Create a data visualization as a team
* Create a machine learning model as a team

## Logistics

### Module Contacts
**Questions can be submitted to the #questions channel on Slack**

* Technical Facilitator: 
  * name and pronouns: `<Name>`, `<Pronouns>` 
  * email: `<first_name.last_name@mail.ca>`
* Learning Support Staff: 
  * name and pronouns: `<Name>`, `<Pronouns>` 
  * email: `<first_name.last_name@mail.ca>`

### Delivery of team project
There will only be one lecture and that would be the very first day to introduce the team project to everyone. After, it is up to you and your team members to work together to create a project. The Technical Facilitator and Learning Support Staff will be present to assist and check up on the progress of work.
 
### Expectations
Learners are expected to be working their normal synchronous hours along with their team members.
 
## Requirements
* Learners are not expected to have any coding experience, we designed the learning content for beginners.
* Learners are encouraged to ask questions and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
* Learners must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Learners are expected to follow along with the coding.
* Learners must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code to complete assignments. It should be used as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect learners to have completed the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/tree/main/onboarding_documents).
* Webcam usage is optional although highly encouraged. We understand that not everyone may have the space at home to have the camera on.

* **Data:** Contains the raw, processed and final data. For any data living in a database, make sure to export the tables out into the `sql` folder, so it can be used by anyone else.
* **Experiments:** A folder for experiments
* **Models:** A folder containing trained models or model predictions
* **Reports:** Generated HTML, PDF etc. of your report
* **src:** Project source code
* README: This file!
* .gitignore: Files to exclude from this folder, specified by the Technical Facilitator
